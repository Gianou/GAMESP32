# GAMESP32

Game Engine for ESP32 based gaming console. This repository shows the development steps of a Game Engine meant to run on custom ESP32-S3 gaming device.  
  
The project was realised for my bachelor thesis, Coding a 2D Game Engine for ESP32: A Showcase of Design Patterns, in software development at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.

## Repository's Structure
You can follow the development process of this project by checking out the branches. Each branch corresponds to a chapter of the thesis.

Each branch has a README file explaining what the goal of the iteration. 

The main branch contains the most up-to-date version of the code. Iteration branches are merged into the main once they are completed.
